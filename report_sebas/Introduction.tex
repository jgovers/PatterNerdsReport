 \section{Introduction}
  \label{Intro}
  This report describes the design and performance of a Pattern Recognition algorithm that is able to classify images of hand-written digits on bank cheques. It considers two cases:
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item \textbf{Case 1: The system is trained only one time, and then used in the field.} This means a large amount of training data is available.
  	\item \textbf{Case 2: The system is trained for each batch of cheques.} This means only a small amount of training data is available.
  \end{itemize}
Although Case 2 provides significantly less data than Case 1 (and this definitely has to be taken into account during the design of the classification system) it is worthy to note that both cases call for a supervised learning approach. \\
The available data will be extracted from the NIST-list, a large dataset containing labelled hand-written digits from 0 to 9. These images will be processed in order to make it easier to handle them. The loading of the list and processing of the images it contains is done in a separate function, named \texttt{myrep.m}. This function is described in detail in section \ref{sec:ImPros}. Implementing the pre-processing in this way enables the inclusion of the image-processing part of the algorithm in a later benchmark test. It also enables the user to keep the pre-processing consistent across the two different cases if desired.\\
\noindent After the processing, two classifiers will be trained, one for each of the aforementioned cases. These classifiers will be stored as $w$, so that they too can be implemented in the benchmark test. The design of these classifiers is described in detail in section \ref{sec:ClasDes}. \\
Both classifiers will be evaluated using various error estimations. This way, some indication of their performance can be made before sending them to the client. \\
\noindent Finally, to simulate the evaluation by the client for both cases, the benchmark test will be conducted by calling \texttt{e = nist\_eval(myrep,w,n)}. The error $e$ this function returns should be less than 5\% for case 1 and less than 25\% for case 2. An overview of the handling of the data as described in this section can be seen in figure \ref{fig:process_flow}.
